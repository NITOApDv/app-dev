My favourite movie is **Aliens (1986)**, directed by legendary movie director James Cameron as the sequel for Alien (1979), directed by Ridley Scott.

## Plot
Aliens follows the story of Ellen Ripley; sole survivor of the spaceship Nostromo after the events of Alien (1979) after successfully fighting off the xenomorph and going into hypersleep. She gets rescued by space salvagers who discovered her lifeboat floating through space for 50 years. She discovers this and to her horror, discovers the moon of Acheron, formerly LV-426, the planet she first encountered the xenomorph species from has been colonised, and after her investigation regarding the destruction of the Nostromo found that the moon colony has lost contact. With the aid of the United States Colonial Marine Corps (USCMC), she ventures back to Acheron to face the demons of her past and eliminate the xenomorph threat from the universe forever.

In her investigations over the terraforming colony of Hadley's Hope, she and her company squadron of USCMC marines led by one Lieutenant Gorman (William Hope), with Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews) as co-leader, encounters the xenomorphs in the Atmospheric Processor facility for Hadley's Hope—the machine responsible for allowing Acheron to have a breathable atmosphere—and subsequently having half of the squadron, including Apone and their only transport pilots; Corporal Ferro (Colette Hiller) and Private Spunkmeyer (Daniel Kash) be wiped out. Leaving only Private Hudson (Bill Paxton), Private Vazquez (Jenette Goldstein), Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn), Burke (Paul Reiser), Bishop (Lance Henrikson) and Newt (Carrie Henn) as the only surviving members of the attacks. The survivors prepare defences to hold out until they could manage to call for help, however over time with their limited arsenal of military equipment dwindled, and group tensions rose as Burke; a business representative for the Weyland Yutani corporation aims to smuggle the xenomorphs out of Acheron to profit off the aliens potential as a bioweapon.

The initial attack in the Atmospheric Processor caused irreparable damage to the facility's fusion reactor, the survivors had little choice but to get out of the moon and back to Earth themselves. Vazquez and Hudson killed during their escape. The sole survivor Newt, was abducted by the aliens; Ripley pursues them only to come face to face with the alien queen while Bishop calls upon another shuttle from the mothership they launched to pick them up. After a hard battle with the alien queen they make it back to their mothership and go back into hypersleep as they make their way back home to Earth.
