My favourite movie is **Aliens (1986)**, directed by legendary movie director James Cameron as the sequel for Alien (1979), directed by Ridley Scott.

Aliens follows the story of Ellen Ripley; sole survivor of the spaceship Nostromo after the events of Alien (1979) after successfully fighting off the xenomorph and going into hypersleep. She gets rescued by space salvagers who discovered her lifeboat floating through space for 50 years. She discovers this and to her horror, discovers the moon of LV-426, the planet she first encountered the xenomorph species from has been colonised, and after her investigation regarding the destruction of the Nostromo found that the moon colony has lost contact. With the aid of the United States Colonial Marine Corps (USCMC), she ventures back to LV-426 to face the demons of her past and eliminate the xenomorph threat from the universe forever.
